A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.
In a stack, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint. The behavior of a stack is described as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO). 

Operations Performed on Stacks
The following are the basic operations served by stacks.

push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
isEmpty: Checks whether the stack is empty.
isFull: Checks whether the stack is full.
top: Displays the topmost element of the stack.

A queue is basically a linear data structure to store and manipulate the data elements. It follows the order of First In First Out (FIFO).
In queues, the first element entered into the array is the first element to be removed from the array.

the following operations for manipulation on the data elements:

isEmpty(): To check if the queue is empty
isFull(): To check whether the queue is full or not
dequeue(): Removes the element from the frontal side of the queue
enqueue(): It inserts elements to the end of the queue
Front: Pointer element responsible for fetching the first element from the queue
Rear: Pointer element responsible for fetching the last element from the queue
