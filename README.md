A stack is a linear data structure, a collection of items of the same type.
In a stack, the insertion and deletion of elements happen only at one endpoint. The behavior of a stack is described as “Last In, First Out” (LIFO). 

Operations Performed on Stacks
The following are the basic operations served by stacks.

push: Adds an element to the top of the stack.
pop: Removes the topmost element from the stack.
isEmpty: Checks whether the stack is empty.
isFull: Checks whether the stack is full.
top: Displays the topmost element of the stack.
